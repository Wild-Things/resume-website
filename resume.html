                <p>My goal is to break into cybersecurity in the long term and attend 
                    hacking conventions over the coming years. By getting exposure to
                    many different disciplines as I'm learning, I'm hoping to merge this
                    with my existing background in music and events and leverage that as a 
                    side hustle of some sort.
